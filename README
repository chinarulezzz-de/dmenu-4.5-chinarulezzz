dmenu - dynamic menu
====================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.

This is my fork of dmenu 4.5 which has a minimal functional code base
that I want.

This fork is extended with several patches:

- xft

  FreeType fonts. No fallback. Minimal patch.

- [xkbswitch](https://github.com/chinarulezzz-de/xkbswitch)

  Switch to latin keyboard layout (or which you wish) before starting
  dmenu, and switch back after exit.

- borders

  A little hack for my [dwm](https://chinarulezzz/dwm-6.0)
  'Feng Shui' :)

Requirements
------------
In order to build dmenu you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dmenu
-------------
See the man page for details.
